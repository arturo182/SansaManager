SansaManager 0.1.6
======

What is this?
------------
This is my most successful application to date. It was created in 2007 (which is kinda sad).
SansaManager was software for managing Sandisk mp3 player - Sansa. It had built in music and playlists manager, photo converter, podcasts downloader, shoutcasts player, recordings converter and it was compatible with RockBox.

Installation
------------
The compiled files are in the OUT directory. I would not recommend trying to compile it, it uses a LOT of components and they are not in this repo. 
Good luck with that.

Why?
------------
Because it's a part of me and is a symbol that with enough determination I can create something download-worthy.
I don't want it to be forgotten, neither to be remembered too much.
